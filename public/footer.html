				A confcon management system is web-based software that supports the organization of conferences especially scientific conferences. It helps the program chair(s), the conference organizers, the authors and the reviewers in their respective activities. Attendees will be able to view various conferences being hosted by geographic location, register for the conferences, view other attendees, read abstracts, register for specific talks, and share information with other attendees. Presenters can also use the application to post abstracts for their talks, share talk materials such as source code, slides, and video presentations, describe the talk, and answer to feedback.
